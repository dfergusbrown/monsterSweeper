# Project Proposal - Monster Sweeper

## Project Choice (Tell us which project you're doing!)

- [ ] minesweeper variation

## Project Description 

This project is a minesweeper variation via the world of Monsters Inc.  The player presses the play button and then opens one of the doors by clicking a square.  This square will reveal either a blank space or a number which would indicate how many monsters lying in wait there are in directly adjacent squares.  As the player goes along, they can flag a door when they believe there's a monster behind it or open a door to guess that there isn't until they run into one monster (game over) or all non-monster squares have been revealed (win-con).

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want my game to have some instructions directing how to play the game (left click reveal, right click = flag)
- As a player, I want the gameboard to be randomized each time so that the monster configurations are different
- As a player, I want the game to recognize clicks for revealing squares and flagging squares
- As a player, I want the game to recognize win and lose conditions
- As a player, I want the game to reveal some adjacent blank squares when I find a blank square

#### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like to see some kind of animation when the door is opened, a monster is found, and upon winning
- As a player, I would like to hear game sounds for the same aforementioned events
- As a player, I would like to enter in different grid dimensions to play a custom game
