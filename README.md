- **Title**: 'CDA: Junior Detector' (Child Detection Agency)
- **Description**:
    In the style of the classic, 'minesweeper', this build is set in the universe of a popular unnamed film.  Try to mark each door with caution tape (flag) that has a child behind it or open up every door that doesn't. As in minesweeper, each number revealed indicates how many mines (or children in this instance) lay await one/some of the 8 surrounding squares.

    Minesweeper is a great solitaire-style game that can test your ability for logic and deduction. Seeing the analagous elements between minesweeper and the concept of children and doors in the monster universe inspired me to build this browser game.
